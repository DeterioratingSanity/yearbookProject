        <p class="sectTitle" id="four">The Revolt of the Turtles | <br>&emsp;Stephen Dunn</p>
        <p class="content">
          On gray forgetful mornings like this<br>
          sea turtles would gather in the shallow waters<br>
          of the Gulf to discuss issues of self-presentation<br>
          and related concerns like, If there were a God<br>
          would he have a hard shell and a retractable head,<br>
          and whether speed on land<br>
          was of any importance to a good swimmer.<br>
          <br>
          They knew that tourists needed to placate<br>
          their children with catchy stories, and amuse<br>
          themselves with various cruelties<br>
          such as turning turtles over on their backs<br>
          and watching their legs wriggle.<br>
          So the turtles formed a committee to address<br>
          <br>
          How to Live Among People Who Among<br>
          Other Atrocities Want to Turn You into Soup.<br>
          <br>
          The committee was also charged with wondering<br>
          if God would mind a retelling of their lives,<br>
          one in which sea turtles <br>
          were responsible for all things<br>
          right-minded and progressive, and men<br>
          and women for poisoning the water.<br>
          <br>
          The oldest sea turtle among them knew<br>
          that whoever was in control of the stories<br>
          controlled all the shoulds and should-nots.<br>
          But he wasn’t interested in punishment,<br>
          only ways in which power could bring about<br>
          fairness and decency. And when he finished speaking <br>
          in the now-memorable and ever-deepening<br>
          <br>
          waters of the Gulf, all the sea turtles<br>
          began to chant, Only fairness, only decency.<br>

        <p class="sectTitle" id="five">On the Psychological Effect <br>&emsp; of Living with Houseplants | <br>&emsp; Stephanie Bishop</p>
        <p class="content">
          Not long ago I found myself in<br>
          conversation with a group of people about<br>
          the effect of living with houseplants. They<br>
          were proselytising the health benefits and<br>
          comparing Instagram shots on their<br>
          phones, where everyone aspired to the<br>
          same sparse white living room decorated<br>
          with pops of green. I confessed however,<br>
          that I couldn’t keep a houseplant alive—I<br>
          couldn’t keep a houseplant alive to save<br>
          my life, I think I said—and that despite my<br>
          desire to do otherwise, this is one thing<br>
          that I routinely fail at. I say to my husband,<br>
          ‘Look, it is dying,’ and he says, ‘That’s<br>
          because it just needs water.’ Even though I<br>
          know this, even though he has told me, I<br>
          still do not water it. Instead, some small<br>
          voice in me insists that the plant has it in<br>
          itself to survive a little longer. My husband<br>
          takes pity on the limp leaves, he worries<br>
          about them, and waters the plant with care<br>
          from a special can with a long narrow<br>
          spout that allows him to direct the water<br>
          with great precision, at the very base of<br>
          the plant where the pale stem descends<br>
          into the pot of soil. I am grateful that he<br>
          does this because I cannot, because the<br>
          thoughts I direct to the plant are the same<br>
          thoughts I direct to myself, which are the<br>
          thoughts, I realise, that my mother<br>
          directed to me: You don’t need to eat yet,<br>
          You can’t possibly still be thirsty, How can<br>
          you be tired already? Surely you can do<br>
          better than that. Both my husband and I<br>
          humanise our houseplants, we<br>
          anthropomorphise them, and because of<br>
          this I look at the living plant and think it<br>
          should make its livingness go a little<br>
          further, stretch it out, test it, live harder<br>
          on less, strive to be upright, and each time<br>
          I do this I feel myself dehumanised, little<br>
          by little more. I would like not to be this<br>
          kind of person, this person who refuses to<br>
          give water when water is so clearly needed.<br>
          But it runs in the family, this failure to<br>
          keep houseplants alive. My mother cannot<br>
          do it either, and now I wonder how her<br>
          mother spoke to her, which might have<br>
          been the same but could have been<br>
          different or perhaps it was just split<br>
          somehow because I remember my<br>
          grandmother tending a patio of brilliantly<br>
          flowering impatiens, red and orange and<br>
          hot pink, and on her coffee table there was<br>
          always a vase of deeply perfumed roses<br>
          that she had grown herself. Perhaps she<br>
          told her daughter, my mother, to hurry on<br>
          now and not bother her and sort her<br>
          livingness out on her own because she had<br>
          houseplants to water.<br>

          that easy old couple, limber<br>

          strolling, maybe just finished jogging,<br>
          under the plum trees.<br>

          gray heads the air<br>
          is pink with blossoms<br>
          accomplishing themselves;<br>

          the sidewalk’s pink with petals.<br>
          <br>
          She turns to him and speaks, a word<br>
          that fills and falls like another petal,<br>
          easy, simple:<br>
          a word of thirst?—milk? wine?—<br>
          a word of love?—good run?—<br>
          <br>
          whatever,<br>
          it befalls him<br>
          light as the stroke of a branch,<br>
          clear as color,<br>
          and he nods, smiles.<br>
          <br>
          I want to learn that word, I want<br>
          to hold that word under my tongue<br>
          like a sip of milk,<br>
          I want to inhale that word<br>
          the way that gray-haired woman, now,<br>
          <br>
          turns back to the tree<br>
          and inhales the lucid perfume<br>
          of a blossom that promises<br>
          ripeness, night, the sweetness<br>
          of the plum.<br>

          Honey in the horn! I brought my horse from the water<br>
          And from the white grove of tall alders over the spring,<br>
          And brought him past a row of high hollyhocks<br>
          Which flew and tore their flowers thin as his mane.<br>
          <br>
          And women there watched, with hair blown over their mouths;<br>
          Yet in watching the oat field they were quiet as the spring<br>.
          <br>
          “Are the hollyhocks full bloomed? It is harvest then.<br>
          The hay falls like sand falling in a high wind<br>
          When the weeds blow and fly—but steady the sand falls.<br>
          It is harvest, harvest, and honey in the horn.<br>
          I would like to go out, in a few days, through the stubble field,<br>
          And to all the springs—yours too we have known for years—<br>
          And to the bearing vines, and clean the berries from them.”<br>
          <br>
          Call, women!—why do you stand if not for your pride’s sake?<br>
          <br>
          But the women would neither call to me nor speak,<br>
          Nor to any man not mowing during their harvest.<br>
          They watched with their hair blowing, near the stalks,<br>
          In the row of red hollyhocks<br>
          <br>
          Quiet as the spring.<br>
          What is by the spring? A bird, and a few old leaves.<br>

          have passed among them some milk-bottle of<br>
          cool water which I felt flowed more like love,<br>
          a drinking whose raw beauty fully hurt.<br>
          <br>
          Each mouth touched where the other four had been:<br>

          beautifully caused to blossom from decay.<br>
          <br>
          That was the way, that was the wealth of way<br>
          they spent and went in water man to man,<br>
          common and strong and world to understand.<br>
          That was their way, and this is what we pay<br>
          <br>
          in learning understanding from those five:<br>
          envy that summer touches them to thirst<br>
          for gifts of back-lot water, and this first<br>
          sheer pain that drinking means to be alive.<br>

          The dark men from Oporto came to my door<br>
          and hammered. The dark men had meat and bread<br>
          on their palms when they swaggered away<br>
          beneath a sky the wind had scoured dead<br>
          and lusterless, stalked out in the soundless day.<br>
          <br>
          Then the cat walked in, sniffed her plate<br>
          and next the tiles where the Oporto men<br>
          had stood … Dogs barked at last, but phlox<br>
          gaped silence at the hedge … they barked again,<br>
          even the scented one on the garden rocks.<br>
          <br>
          I saw the dark Oporto men from all my doors,<br>
          my windows. I feared. But to the white lips<br>
          along the walls I said: “Surely the wine<br>
          of Oporto still swells in the grape and drips<br>
          its fellowship somewhere to be to this as anodyne.”<br>
          <br>
          Wine is a civilized thing … and mellow words<br>
          of comfort aim for the jocular rib; and hope …<br>
          “These,” I said by the wish made glib, “These<br>
          were only crows from some raucous slope<br>
          and are returning there to croak in the trees.”<br>
          <br>
          .....<br>
          <br>
          Ah, the dogs are dead, the scented one lies deep<br>
          under bloody earth in the housemaid’s lap.<br>
          The Oporto men worked well … and very near<br>
          one crow caws—sometimes lifting its wings to flap—<br>
          where only a tailless cat is left to hear.<br>
